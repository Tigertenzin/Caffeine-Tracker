# Caffeine Tracker
 
 Unfinished caffeine tracker app for iOS

Current features of the app: 

- It interacts with HealthKit to add data points on caffeine intake (in mg). 
- Added and existing data is shown in the app, after proper permissions are granted. 
- Shows all entries in a list (chronologically ordered)
- **Predefined entries** can be created for quickly adding common items (e.g. cup of coffee)
- Statistics screen shows bar graphs of weekly and monthly caffeine intake, and a pie chart breaking down categories. 
- Daily goals for caffeine intake (to try and not go over). 

The project is unpolished and unfinished but, for the most part, functional. Bugs are present, especially when trying to interface with HealthKit and preexisting data. 

Other features were also planned, such as incorporating water intake and sleep hours, to try and correlate these with caffeine intake. Maybe for the future.
